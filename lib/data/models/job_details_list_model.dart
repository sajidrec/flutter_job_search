NextAfter, web developers are critical in allowing our nonprofit clients to escape the shackles of poorly designed software. Out-of-the-box software solutions rarely allow nonprofits the flexibility necessary to track every donor action or to make design tweaks to improve donor conversion. That is where you come in.\n\nIn this role, you will be charged with helping organizations make websites do things they were never designed to do. You’ll apply your HTML, Javascript, and CSS skills toward crafting unique solutions to solve complex problems across a variety of different web platforms.\n\nBecause NextAfter works solely with nonprofits to help them raise money and awareness for their causes, it’s also essential that every member on our team desires to positively impact the world around them and cares about the people they’re serving alongside and those at the organizations we help.\n\nThe Front End Web Developer supports NextAfter’s efforts to discover what drives donors to give through setting up A/B experiments and optimizing the tracking of various advertising efforts.\n\nEssential Duties and Responsibilities include the following. Other duties may be assigned.\n• Setting up A/B experiments utilizing VWO, Optimizely, and similiar platforms. This will involve writing Javascript, HTML, and CSS to override existing page layout and design.\n• Implementing enhanced tracking to monitor the fundraising and marketing efforts. This is normally done with platforms such as Google Tag Manager, Google Analytics, Facebook, Google Ads, and other advertising platforms.\n• Configuring marketing software such as Mailchimp, Hubspot, and similar tools to serve the needs of the nonprofit clients that we work with.
